Nifty patterns to use and change-up

s "bd [hh*6 bd] <sd sd*2 sd*3 sd*10> [hh sd] bd hh sd <ho ho*2> ?"

every 4 (rev) $ s " bd [sd | sd*4 | sd*6] sd [bd hh] sd hh ho?" # pan sine

n "c*7 b d e" # s "kurt"

n "c*27 b*37 d*10 e" # s "kurt"

n "c6 b c6 e8 c6 c6 e8 b c6" # s "pluck" # pan sine

// brooding convoluted growl sound
n "c*69" # s "moog" # pan (fast 1 $ range 200 5000 $ sine)


Super wide pan copy pasta:

Our group philosophy:

Collectively, we decided to not assign roles. As per our initial jam in class,
we found that we were very functional and balanced just playing off of one
another by ear. For communication purposes, we set up a discord server so that
we could share fragments of code that we thought sounded interesting, and so we
could discuss the project requirements.


My method for navigating live coding:

Because of the non-traditional nature of live coding, I realized that I was
going to feel a little artistically lost if I didn’t try and ground myself with
certain musical cliches. One of the most neutral ways for me to achieve this, I
realized, was to create melodic patterns on the simpler side which typically
drone and glitch about. I realized that abandoning the feelings associated with
time was easier than leaving behind melodic expectations, and I think that it is
hard for me to enjoy computer-based music when all sense of traditional tonality
is abandoned. Thus, I try and contribute to my group with simple “do” to “ti”
droning patterns that can easily be layered upon and modified to glitch out and
become more interesting.
